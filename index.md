# Project Brainstorming Prompts
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most fascinating topic covered this quarter is the diverse techniques that we can use to categorize transaction data. We explored various models and methods for feature engineering that allow us to build meaningful, interpretable features from raw financial data from Prism Data. Observing these large-scale, sophisticated methods has offered valuable insights and provided me with a practical perspective on how transaction data can be transformed into actionable insights in industry settings. It’s exciting to compare this real-world application to the categorization model we’re building in our current project, which is similar in purpose but smaller in scope and complexity.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For the Quarter 2 project, I’d like to expand upon the foundational models we're developing in Quarter 1, which involve transaction categorization and income prediction, by creating a model that can generate a credit score. The idea is to assess consumer risk by predicting the likelihood of individuals failing to meet their financial obligations. This credit score model would consider not just income but also spending habits, frequency and amount of transactions, payment history, and other financial behaviors that could indicate creditworthiness. This project would incorporate various predictive techniques to better evaluate consumer risk profiles and create a score that could be beneficial for lending institutions or financial services.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I’ve appreciated the structured and supportive environment of my section, especially in terms of communication—they respond quickly to my emails and keep our tasks well-organized. However, I would love to receive more detailed feedback on our weekly assignments. Currently, we get code-related questions that we answer and present to the group each week. While we’re encouraged to discuss our approaches and show our code, the feedback typically consists of a simple acknowledgment, like "good job," before moving to the next group. More in-depth, constructive feedback would be valuable, as it could help us refine our methods and learn from their expertise. I’d appreciate insights on what they think of our approaches, how they might enhance or streamline them, and if similar methods are used in professional contexts.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I’m interested in integrating anomaly detection techniques to enhance our model’s ability to identify unusual or high-risk transaction patterns, which could indicate potential fraud or signs of financial distress. Anomaly detection methods could be adapted to recognize outlier behaviors in consumer transactions, adding an essential layer of financial security to our categorization and risk scoring processes. By identifying anomalous patterns, we could help financial institutions proactively address potential fraud or assess consumers’ financial health with a finer level of detail.

I’m also intrigued by the possibility of using hybrid models that combine rule-based and machine learning approaches. A rule-based layer could incorporate domain-specific insights and business logic, such as transaction thresholds or mandatory categorization rules, which traditional machine learning algorithms might overlook. This hybrid approach could improve the model’s interpretability and precision by creating rules to handle specific edge cases or known patterns, allowing the machine learning model to focus on capturing more complex relationships. Together, these techniques would create a robust, adaptable model that can deliver high accuracy while remaining sensitive to the unique demands of the financial domain.
